Coding plan as of 2/10:

1. Swerve (complete)
2. Intake on button press
3. Shoot on button press
4. Rotate arm on button press (will require a lead/follow and a reversed motor)
5. Climbers on button press (complete)
6. Climbers brake on button press
7. Lead screw on button press
8. Arm PID with positions : intake, shoot, amp
9. Lead screw PID with positions : extended, retracted
10. Detection of note in intake using sensor
11. Basic auto paths (complete)
12. Sequential auto paths (move back, intake, shoot, move to new location, intake, shoot)
Novelties

13. Limelight apriltag detection for scoring and PID adjustment of arm - very complex
14. Incorporation of a laserCAN to detect notes in front of robot
15. LED event driven signaling
